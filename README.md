# sockspeak
A simple python script to speak to another computer using sockets

Trying to display the messages and have and input. Either going to use Tkinter or curses. I will later add encryption

Currently i'm learning new modules (curses, argparse) and so it is quite clumsy code and i wasn't thinking of commenting while writing the code

I will add comments once i clean the code
